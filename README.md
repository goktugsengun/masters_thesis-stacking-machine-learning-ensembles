Abstract
This thesis investigates the potential for maximizing ensemble model performance
by introducing diversity in the context of default prediction in financial markets.
Default prediction is essential for financial institutions, as it enables more accurate
assessment of credit risk and enhances the management of lending portfolios.
Traditional models often fall short in capturing the complexity of financial data,
underscoring the need for more advanced techniques. This research focuses on
stacking ensembles, examining how diversity among the models can enhance
predictive performance. While the study includes comparisons with widely used
methods like Random Forest, XGBoost and AdaBoost. The primary emphasis is on
evaluating the effectiveness of stacking ensembles and exploring the potential
benefits of introducing diversity within these ensembles.
The thesis also addresses key challenges in default prediction, including data
imbalance, missing values and high dimensionality while exploring how diverse
stacking ensembles can help mitigating these issues. The findings suggest that
incorporating strong individual models like XGBoost and Random Forest in diverse
stacking ensembles can lead to significant improvements in predictive performance.
This research aims to contribute to the field by demonstrating the value of model
diversity in maximizing ensemble performance and provides insights for future work,
particularly in refining diversity measures, handling data anomalies, and developing
more comprehensive performance metrics for advance predictive modeling in
financial risk management.
